*** Firebase Compatibility Imports ***

If you are using a version of firebase that's greater than v8, you will encounter the import error

Attempted import error: 'firebase/app' does not contain a default export (imported as 'firebase').

The same will be true for other firebase imports that we use in this project!

There is an easy fix for this though, firebase includes backward compatibility. All you need to is change your import from firebase/app to firebase/compat/app. The same is true for all our other imports.

So from:

import firebase from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/firestore';
import 'firebase/auth';
to:

import firebase from 'firebase/compat/app';
import 'firebase/compat/firestore';
import 'firebase/compat/auth';

*** Optional: How to fix 403: restricted_client error ***
It's possible you may encounter a google Authorization error that says 403:restricted_client. If you do, here are the instructions to fix it!

There should be a Learn More link in the popup, clicking that should take you to the Google APIs console that has three tabs under the header named Credentials, OAuth Consent Screen, and Domain Verification. Go to the OAuth Consent Screen tab and update the Application Name to "crwn-clothing" or any other name you're comfortable with (i.e. the name of your project). Click on save at the bottom, then try logging into your verified Google account thereafter.
